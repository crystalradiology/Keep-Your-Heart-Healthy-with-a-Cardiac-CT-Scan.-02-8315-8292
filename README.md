When it comes to your health, your heart deserves top priority. It works around the clock, pumping blood and oxygen to every part of your body. However, heart disease is still one of the leading causes of illness and death worldwide. That’s why keeping your heart healthy through early detection and regular check-ups is so important. The Cardiac CT scan is one of the most effective tools for monitoring your heart's health.

At Crystal Radiology, we are proud to offer advanced imaging solutions that help detect heart problems before they become serious. Our Cardiac CT scan at Crystal Radiology provides a fast, safe, and non-invasive way to get a clear picture of your heart and blood vessels. Let’s explore how this powerful tool can help you take control of your heart health.

What Is a Cardiac CT Scan?
A Cardiac CT (Computed Tomography) scan is a special type of X-ray that creates detailed 3d images of your heart and its surrounding structures, including the coronary arteries. Unlike traditional chest X-rays, which provide limited information, a Cardiac CT scan captures cross-sectional images that show the inside of your heart and blood vessels in amazing detail.

This scan is often used to detect heart disease, check for blockages in the arteries, monitor heart conditions, or assess the effectiveness of previous treatments like stents or bypass surgery.

Why Should You Consider a Cardiac CT Scan?
Heart disease can develop silently, without any noticeable symptoms. By the time you feel chest pain or breathlessness, damage may already be happening. A Cardiac CT scan at Crystal Radiology can catch early signs of trouble, giving you and your doctor time to act before the condition worsens.

Here are just a few reasons to consider having a Cardiac CT scan:

·         You have a family history of heart disease.

·         You experience symptoms like chest discomfort or shortness of breath.

·         You have risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or smoking.

·         You want a thorough heart check-up for peace of mind.

What Can a Cardiac CT Scan Detect?
Cardiac CT scans can reveal a variety of heart conditions, including:

·         Coronary artery disease: A buildup of plaque in the arteries that can lead to a heart attack

·         Calcium scoring: Measures the amount of calcium in your arteries to assess heart disease risk

·         Congenital heart defects: Structural problems in the heart that may be present from birth

·         Aneurysms: A Bulge in the artery wall that could rupture if not detected early

·         Pericardial disease: Inflammation or fluid buildup around the heart

·         Heart valve issues: Helps assess whether valves are opening and closing properly

These scans are also helpful for planning surgeries or other heart procedures.

Is It Safe?
Yes, a Cardiac CT scan is a safe procedure. The amount of radiation used is low and kept to the minimum necessary to get clear images. At Crystal Radiology, your safety is our top priority. We use the latest CT technology that reduces radiation exposure while still providing high-quality images. Our experienced radiology team ensures every scan is performed with the utmost care.
